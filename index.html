            Alison Lubar teaches high school English by day and yoga by night.
            Her life's work, aside from wordsmithing, has evolved into bringing
            mindfulness practices, and sometimes even poetry, to young people.
            Her work has been published by or appeared in SWWIM Every Day,
            trampset, The Esthetic Apostle, Lady Blue Literary Arts Journal,
            Cathexis Northwest Press, High Shelf, Gravitas, great weather for
            MEDIA, Toho, Rowan University’s Glassworks, Giovanni’s Room
            anthology
            <em>queerbook</em>; she has work forthcoming with Fearsome Critters,
            Storm of Blue Press, and Apiary Magazine. <br /><br />
            Alison graduated from the University of Delaware in 2007, with a
            double major in Philosophy and Italian literature. In 2009, while
            teaching at University City High School in West Philadelphia, she
            received her MS Ed with a concentration in Urban Education from the
            University of Pennsylvania. In 2016, after completing a 95hr Kids'
            Yoga Teacher Training, she finished her RYT 200 with Anjali Power
            Yoga, where she teaches power vinyasa classes. Alison also currently
            teaches at a public high school in New Jersey, where she has created
            courses in philosophy, mindfulness, & yoga, and developed an
            restorative practices program.
            <br /><br />
            Though she is Californian by birth, Alison currently lives in New
            Jersey with her partner and their respective dogs. She hopes to one
            day, with her pack, return Westward.
